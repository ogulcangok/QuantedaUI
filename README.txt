#STEPS
In order to extract the years from date; after uploading the csv close the window and reboot. This will update the global variable year with the given year values.

Not the most practical solution but the best one yet. 

If you get an error stating that "year cannot found". on the top of the script run the code

year <- ""

this will initialize the global variable year. Resr of the code will handle the rest but still after uploading the csv you will need to restart the app in order the get the year values.


#TODO
Text column should be given by hand beforehand. Automation could not be done

DO NOT upload the big file yet. Bandwith will be investigated further.
